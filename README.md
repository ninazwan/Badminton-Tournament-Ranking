# Badminton Tournament Ranking

This Excel project is a ranking system designed to manage tournaments consisting of multiple events (e.g., a 10-tournament season).  
It was originally designed for badminton but it can be adapted for other sports or types of competitions.

## Features
- Automated point calculation using VBA for each tournament.
- The VBA function assigns ranking points based on tournament rules (e.g., 1st place = 100 points, 2nd place = 80 points, etc.).
- Overall ranking showing the total score of each player across all categories they participated in during the 10 tournaments of the season.

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Adjust the point allocation in VBA to match your tournamentâ€™s regulations.
3. Enter players and their placements in each tournament event in the designated sheets.
4. Rankings and total points for the season are automatically updated.

## Notes
- A separate **demo workbook** is included as an example.
- The data in the demo workbook is random and does not represent real players or results.
- Enable macros to allow automatic calculations.
