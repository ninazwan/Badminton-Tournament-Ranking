# Badminton Tournament Ranking

This Excel project is a ranking system designed to manage tournaments consisting of multiple events (e.g., a 10-tournament season).  
It was originally designed for badminton but it can be easily adapted for other sports or types of competitions.

## Features
- Automated point calculation using VBA for each tournament.
- The VBA function assigns ranking points based on tournament rules (e.g., 1st place = 100 points, 2nd place = 80 points, etc.).
- Overall ranking that aggregates results across all 10 tournaments in the season.
- A summary table showing the **total score of each player across all categories** they participated in.

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Adjust the point allocation in VBA to match your tournamentâ€™s regulations.
3. Enter players and tournament results for each event in the designated sheet.
4. Rankings and total points for the season are automatically updated via VBA.

## Notes
- A separate **demo workbook** is included to showcase functionality.
- Ensure macros are enabled to allow automatic calculations.
